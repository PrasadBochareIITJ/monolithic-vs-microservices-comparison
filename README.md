# Monolithic vs Microservices Performance Comparison

This project compares the performance of monolithic and microservices architectures by implementing both structures in a simulated environment. Metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and response time are analyzed under varying loads.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrasadBochareIITJ/monolithic-vs-microservices-comparison.git
